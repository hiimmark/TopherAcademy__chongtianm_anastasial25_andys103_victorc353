Restaurant reserving app for customers and managers. On the customers side, they should be able to select # of people they expect to being & the time, then the app should return available slots. They can claim/change a reservation through accessing their account. On the manager side, they will be able to setup the layout of the restaurant (i.e. input coordinates for each table, minimum capacity of each table, waitlist managing) and view reserved tables.
